=head1 NAME

URI::Encode::XS - a Perl URI encoder/decoder using C

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use URI::Encode::XS qw/uri_encode uri_decode/;

  my $encoded = uri_encode($data);
  my $decoded = uri_decode($encoded);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Perl module that wraps my C URI encoder/decoder based on
L<RFC3986|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>. This module always
encodes characters that are not unreserved.

I've benchmarked it and found it significantly faster than URI::Escape at
encoding and decoding:

              Rate escape encode
escape    142861/s     --   -96%
encode   3685811/s  2480%     --
              Rate unescape   decode
unescape  197481/s       --     -94%
decode   3101884/s    1471%       --

However this is just one string - the fewer encoded/decoded characters are
in the string, the closer the benchmark is likely to be (see C<bench> for
details). Different hardware will yield different results.

For a fast encoder/decoder which supports custom escape lists, check out
L<URI::XSEscape|https://metacpan.org/pod/URI::XSEscape>.
